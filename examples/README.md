# RINFAIRE example scripts

1. Generate a "multinetwork" containing individual networks for a set of structures:

run_generate_multi.sh

2. Generate a sum network for the entire multinetwork, including scaling and visualization:

run_analysis_sum.sh

3. Generate a sum network for a subset of the multinetwork, including scaling and visualization (alternative to step 2):

run_analysis_sum_subset.sh

4. Evaluate overlap between sum network and user-defined residues of interest, including statistical significance:

run_analysis_residues_of_interest.sh

Please note that any additional example scripts may not have been tested with the current code so should be used with caution.
